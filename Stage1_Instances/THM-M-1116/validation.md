# Intake validation

Base revision: `9562952daaa9a03ced35f2b4f4a336345b0ea802`.

Validation is limited to manifest consistency, dossier structure, scoped intake invariants, the
available pinned Lean executable, and whitespace. No canonical Lean expression has been selected,
so no elaboration or kernel-proof result is claimed. No `.lake` content was fetched or mutated.

Known downstream failures are exact primary-source selection and independent review, canonical
Lean elaboration and mutation tests, formal-anchor audit, obligation registry, proof, hermetic
replay, and release validation. They prevent theorem completion but do not invalidate this
fail-closed planned intake.
