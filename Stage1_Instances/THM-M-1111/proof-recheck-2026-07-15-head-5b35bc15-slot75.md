## First failed gate

`S56-5.1-EXACT-TARGET-CONSISTENCY / M1111-S-DEFS` fails. The frozen declaration
`TaoVuFourMomentTarget` accepts an arbitrary `FourMomentSemantics`, but the structure imposes no
laws on `powerBound` or its other semantic operations. The placeholder-free theorem
`not_taoVuFourMomentTarget_counterSemantics` supplies an admissible instance with `Unit` carriers,
all hypothesis predicates true, both expected statistics zero, and `powerBound` constantly `-1`.
At `epsilon = 1/2`, `k = C = C' = 1`, `n = 2 * (N + 1)`, and index `N + 1`, every premise holds
while the conclusion reduces to `0 <= -1`. Pinned Lean checks the negation of the exact target at
this instance.

This refutes the abstract encoding, not the Tao--Vu Four Moment Theorem for a future source-faithful
semantics. A generic positive proof body for the frozen target family would be inconsistent.
Selecting a favorable semantics, adding the comparison as an assumption, or using
`FourMomentComparisonPackage` (definitionally the open root) would specialize, circularly assume,
or substitute the theorem and is not permitted proof work.

## Current-base evidence

The latest integrated blocker packet is based on `5282ca27`. A scoped `git diff --exit-code` shows
that the statement, countermodel, conditional composition, statement metadata, anchor audit,
obligation registry, and typed graphs are byte-unchanged from that base through `5b35bc15`. Their
exact hashes and structured results are recorded in the companion JSON packet.

The narrow replay used only existing pinned artifacts:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
root=$PWD
tmp=$(mktemp -d /tmp/thm-m-1111-slot75-head5b35bc15.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT

```

Lean was `4.29.0` at commit `98dc76e3c0a9b856c9b98726b713fb04fab16740`; pinned mathlib was
`8a178386ffc0f5fef0b77738bb5449d50efeea95` (tree
`bdc39a3123201dae413a9d9be56ec242c19e5c2b`). The automation-provided untracked `.lake` symlink was
reused read-only. The replay used no network; no `lake update`, `lake build`, dependency clone/fetch,
checkout, or `.lake` mutation occurred. Temporary Lean objects were created under `/tmp` and
removed. This is narrow nonrelease corroboration, not validation or release evidence.

## Retry accounting

Twenty-nine earlier current-day proof-recheck packets are already integrated, but the authoritative
proof node still records `attempts=0` and `children=[]`. Blueprint section 10.2 requires splitting
an item after five unresolved execution ticks rather than repeatedly assigning the same oversized
work. Only the integration lane may edit the authoritative DAG/checklist, so this worker records
the mismatch without changing either. This thirtieth unchanged blocker recheck is the mandatory
target-scoped scheduler handoff, not a new proof attempt or proof-progress claim.

## Retry and boundary

Reopen the statement phase and replace the arbitrary interface with a fixed, source-faithful model
of random Hermitian matrices, or add noncircular source-justified laws that rule out the countermodel
and support the comparison estimate. Accept a new statement fingerprint, then refreeze the anchor
audit and obligation denominator before retrying proof work. The master must also split or stop
rescheduling this proof item under section 10.2.

No statement, positive proof body, typed graph, authoritative state, or dependency was changed. The
proof item remains `[ ]`; root, validation, release, audit completion, theorem completion, and master
acceptance remain open. Because the assigned proof phase is incomplete,
`.stage1-worker-selftest.json` is deliberately absent.
