Item: `S56-M-1235-PROOF`

Recheck date: 2026-07-15 (Asia/Shanghai)

Base revision: `9dd7d7ec7d399cdac6abb2a51d3ea55ed5f4b8ca`

## Verdict

`blocked`. A legal positive proof body cannot inhabit the exact frozen target.
The tracked, placeholder-free declaration

```text
Stage1Instances.THMM1235.not_wolibnerGlobalExistenceAndUniqueness :
  Not Stage1Instances.THMM1235.WolibnerGlobalExistenceAndUniqueness
```

kernel-checks at trust level zero against the pinned environment. The fields
`Motion.conditionI_areaPreservingSelfHomeomorphism` through
`Motion.conditionVIII_continuousSpatialDerivatives` are freely chosen values
of type `Prop`; they are not proofs of predicates constraining the five motion
functions. Updating an alleged unique motion's `velocityX` to `velocityX + 1`
therefore preserves the `Motion` type. `SameMotion` would equate the original
and updated velocity functions, but evaluation at `(0, 0), 0` yields the
contradiction `x + 1 = x`. The concrete `counterexampleData` discharges every
explicit premise of the target.

This refutes the frozen formal encoding, not Wolibner's mathematical theorem.
Proving a corrected, weaker, or conditional proposition would be a forbidden
target substitution. The item remains `[ ]`: no positive proof receipt,
accepted obligation, audit completion, theorem completion, validation
completion, release, or master acceptance is claimed. No
`.stage1-worker-selftest.json` is written because the requested positive proof
phase is not genuinely complete.

## Failed Gate And Retry

The first failed gate is `S56-5.1-EXACT-TARGET-CONSISTENCY` at
`M1235-S-DEFINITIONS`. Reopen `S56-M-1235-STATEMENT`, define conditions
`(I)`-`(VIII)` as predicates of the five functions, and make `Motion` carry
proofs of those predicates. Equality must also be scoped to the source domain
and `0 <= t <= T`, unless the primary source justifies equality of the globally
defined functions. Re-audit the source and publish a versioned re-freeze of the
canonical expression fingerprint, source crosswalk, obligation registry,
typed graphs, and dependent evidence before proof execution resumes.

The predecessor `S56-M-1235-OBLIGATION_TREE` remains worker-provisional, so
master proof acceptance is separately dependency-blocked. The authoritative
DAG also still records `attempts=0` and no child nodes despite repeated proof
rechecks. The master/scheduler must reconcile or split the task rather than
schedule another identical proof-only retry. This worker did not edit the DAG
or generated checklist.

## Validation

All checks reused the automation-provided symlink to the existing pinned Lake
closure. No `lake update`, `lake build`, dependency clone/fetch/checkout,
network access, or `.lake` mutation was performed. Temporary Lean sources and
objects were removed. The symlink is untracked, so this is nonrelease evidence.

Exact Lean replay, run from the repository root. The two `lake env` queries
identify the executable and pinned search path; the actual elaborations invoke
that executable directly to avoid Lake-process contention while retaining the
same pinned environment:

```bash
set -euo pipefail
repo_root=$PWD
lean_root=$repo_root/Formalizations/Lean
target=$repo_root/Stage1_Instances/THM-M-1235
tmp=$(mktemp -d /tmp/thm-m-1235-proof-9dd7d7ec-slot33.XXXXXX)
trap 'rm -rf "$tmp"' EXIT HUP INT TERM
cp "$target/Statement.lean" "$tmp/Statement.lean"

## Status Boundary

This current-base artifact is negative, nonrelease blocker evidence. It does
not satisfy `S56-M-1235-PROOF`, propose `[_]` or `[x]`, or support audit or
theorem completion. The retry must begin with statement correction and a
versioned re-freeze; repeating proof search against this encoding cannot close
the item.
