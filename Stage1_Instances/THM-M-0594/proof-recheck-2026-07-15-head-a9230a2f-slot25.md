## Verdict

`blocked`. No placeholder-free proof body for the exact unrestricted
`WhitneyEmbeddingTarget` exists in the pinned dependency closure. This attempt
does not add compactness, weaken the conclusion, or count a conditional
constructor as a proof. The proof item remains `[ ]`, lifecycle remains
`planned`, and the root remains `[H1, M3, R3]`. No receipt acceptance,
validation, release, audit completion, or theorem completion is claimed.
Because the assigned positive proof phase is incomplete,
`.stage1-worker-selftest.json` is deliberately absent.

The exact target covers every finite-dimensional, Hausdorff, second-countable,
boundaryless smooth real manifold. It asks for one map into some
finite-dimensional Euclidean space that is globally smooth, is a topological
embedding, and has injective manifold derivative everywhere. It has neither a
`CompactSpace` premise nor a fixed target-dimension bound.

## First failed gate

`M0594-C-GLOBAL` remains open: no local or pinned proof constructs one finite
Euclidean tuple with injective derivative, global point separation, and
properness on an unrestricted noncompact manifold. The frozen immediate root
cut set remains:

```text
M0594-C-GLOBAL
M0594-L-TOPOLOGICAL
```

The checked bodies in `ProofSupport.lean` derive a compact exhaustion, a
locally finite smooth bump covering, and the proper-injective topological
endpoint. `ObligationTree.lean` checks root assembly from an already supplied
smooth embedding witness. None constructs the finite witness required by the
root.

Pinned mathlib's `SmoothBumpCovering.exists_immersion_euclidean` requires a
finite cover index. `SmoothBumpCovering.fintype` and the terminal
`exists_embedding_euclidean_of_compact` theorem require `CompactSpace M`.
The pinned Whitney module explicitly leaves the sigma-compact weak theorem as
a TODO requiring Sard/Hausdorff-dimension machinery. A scoped search of
repository-local Lean and installed pinned packages found only the exact
statement, conditional/support declarations, and compact specializations. A
read-only inspection of cached mathlib `origin/master` found the same TODO and
restricted endpoints; the cached branch is not a pinned dependency and
receives no proof credit.

## Smallest real validation

All Lean checks used the existing pinned toolchain at trust level zero. The
automation-provided untracked `.lake` symlink was reused read-only. No Lake
update, build, dependency clone/fetch, or `.lake` mutation was run.

## Retry condition

Resume proof execution only after implementing the frozen noncompact weak
Whitney construction with checked child-to-parent composition, or after placing
an immutable, license-compatible proof of the exact unrestricted target into
the pinned repository-local dependency closure. A compact-only theorem,
infinite-dimensional topological embedding, or conditional witness constructor
is not a substitute.

Status boundary: this is fresh current-base nonrelease blocker evidence, not a
positive proof receipt. It does not satisfy `S56-M-0594-PROOF`, propose a
scheduler-state transition, or claim audit completion, theorem completion,
validation, release, receipt acceptance, or master acceptance.
