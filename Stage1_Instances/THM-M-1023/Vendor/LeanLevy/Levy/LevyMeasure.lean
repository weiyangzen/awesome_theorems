# Levy Measures

A **Levy measure** on `ℝ` is a Borel measure `ν` satisfying two conditions:

1. `ν {0} = 0` — no mass at the origin.
2. `∫⁻ x, min(1, x²) dν < ∞` — the integral of `min(1, x²)` is finite.

These conditions arise naturally in the Levy-Khintchine representation of infinitely
divisible distributions: the Levy measure captures the jump structure of the process,
while the vanishing at zero and the integrability condition ensure that the
characteristic exponent is well-defined.

## Main definitions

* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure` — predicate asserting that a measure on `ℝ` is a Levy measure.

## Main results

* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure.zero_singleton` — `ν {0} = 0`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure.lintegral_min_one_sq_lt_top` — the integral condition.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure.measure_setOf_abs_ge_lt_top` — `ν {x | ε ≤ |x|} < ⊤` for `ε > 0`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure.measure_compl_Ioo_lt_top` — `ν (Ioo (-1) 1)ᶜ < ⊤`.
* `ProbabilityTheory.IsLevyMeasure.sigmaFinite` — every Lévy measure is σ-finite.
* `ProbabilityTheory.isLevyMeasure_zero` — the zero measure is a Levy measure.
